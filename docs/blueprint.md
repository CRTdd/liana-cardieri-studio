## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #32298A (a refined indigo) to project a sense of trust and sophistication. The user mentioned that navy (#001524) was being used, and the intention here is to choose a less harsh alternative.
- Background color: #F2F0FA (very light gray-purple), for a calm, professional atmosphere, but slightly different than the pure gray that was mentioned.
- Accent color: #A098C9 (muted periwinkle), used sparingly for highlights and interactive elements, creating a subtle contrast.
- Clean and readable typography, with a focus on Montserrat for headings and body text to convey approachability.
- Use professional icons for services, testimonials and trust badges, ensuring clear communication.
- Employ a minimalist Swiss-style design for a clean, modern layout.
- Incorporate subtle animations on scrolling and hovering.
